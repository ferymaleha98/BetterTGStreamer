### Deploying Your Own

To utilize this project effectively, you will need to deploy three separate applications that work together to handle different aspects of the streaming service:

1. [**BetterTGStreamerBot**](./bot): Manages user requests and file uploads.

2. [**BetterTGStreamerApi**](./api): Streams the M3U8 files.

3. [**BetterTGStreamerDBApi**](./db): Handles data storage using MongoDB.

Each component is crucial for the full functionality of the streaming service, and detailed deployment instructions can be found in their respective repositories.
